# PasswordGenerator

This is a password generator that demonstrates the understanding of HTML,  and Javascript concepts.

It consists of an .html file (index.html) and a .js file (script.js) that will allow the user to enter in a response to designated questions which act as preferences in order to generate a random password.

In order to generate random alphabet letters, I utilitized the charset string that will automatically convert the random number into the corresponding letter.  This link (http://www.net-comber.com/charset.html) showed me what the values were so that I can correctly adjust my formula.
